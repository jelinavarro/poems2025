                some people tell me what i am <br>
                "you are a boy," <br>
                but i've been a girl <br>
                always have been <br>
                yet i'm always pretending, <br>
                pretending to be a boy <br>
                <br>
                do i not look like a girl? <br>
                i love wearing skirts and dress <br>
                and my hair. don't forget my hair，<br>
                my perfectly straight hair <br>
                so silky and long <br>                
                <br>
                so why, <br>
                why do others think i'm a boy?<br>
                <br>
                maybe i should audition for a role<br>
                a role suitable for me<br>
                maybe then they'll say<br>
                ”ah, you're a girl”<br>
                <br>
                nope, i'm still a boy <br>
                <br>
                let's wear and do more girly things <br>
                to make myself beautiful <br>
                maybe wearing more makeup<br>
                will help. <br>
                and maybe walking more like a girl <br>
                maybe changing the way i talk too <br>
                <br>
                wrong, still a boy <br>
                am i just not a girl anymore<br>

                Starting my homework at 11:59 <br>
                is like moving to the city alone. <br>
                <br>
                At 11:59, the wind sneaks <br>
                behind the room's white door <br>
                as the quillow blocks the way. <br>
                The chair creeks without a care. <br>
                Through the window starlight shines, <br>
                touching the edge of the keyboard. <br>
                <br>
                Notifications blind the eyes like the <br>
                shimmering stars of the night, <br>
                ensuring both eyes are aware—— <br>
                it only has a second. <br>
                For as soon as the eyes remember, <br>
                a photo is taken. <br>
                A screenshoot that is as slow as <br>
                buying a snack from a vending <br>
                machine. <br>
                <br>
                Tick tock, I hear the clock. <br>
                I cannot bide my time. <br>
